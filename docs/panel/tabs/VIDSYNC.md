# Video Sync Tab

Syncs a video file with the current log.

## Navigation

### Main Display
Simply the video playback displayed.

### Bottom Menu
Below the main display is the bottom menu. It consists of the videos on the left and the editor on the right.

#### Video List
Click on the Youtube icon to automatically upload a video from Youtube. Click on the file icon to load in a video from your personal computer. Click on <kbd>...</kbd> to access some options, like removing the video or renaming it.

#### Editor
Drag the blue bar around relative to the grey bar, which represents the entire log. Below are some options:
- **Pencil** — Enter a custom timestamp, such that the beginning of the video is that many seconds after the start of the log (`t0`).
- **←** — Alighs the video to the beginning of the log. Essentially, the beginning of the log is the video.
- **←Skip** — Skips the playback position to the beginning of the video.
- **Action** — Triggers the same action as the action button on the bottom navigation of the entire application.
- **→Skip** — Skips the playback position to the end of the video.
- **→** — Aligns the video to the end of the log. Essentially, the end of the log is the end of the video.
- **Lock** — Prevents editing of this specific video, so that you cannot accidentally edit anything.
